    <!-- Project Methodology -->
    <h2>Project Methodology</h2>
    <p>We are following the Agile methodology for this project to ensure flexibility and adaptability throughout the
      development process. Agile allows us to iterate on the project through short sprints, each lasting two weeks, to
      ensure timely delivery and client feedback integration.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scrum Framework:</strong> Weekly stand-ups, sprint planning, and sprint reviews to ensure continuous
        progress and alignment with project goals.</li>
      <li><strong>Sprints:</strong> Development will occur in two-week sprints with a clear objective for each sprint.
      </li>

      <li><strong>3. Development Phase:</strong> The project will follow a modular approach to develop various sections
        such as the homepage, product catalog, and contact forms.</li>
      <li><strong>4. Testing and QA:</strong> Testing will occur after each sprint, focusing on functionality,
        performance, and user experience. Bugs will be tracked and resolved.</li>
